// Type Inference

// TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that can deduce the type of a variable based on its assigned value. In many cases, you don't need to explicitly annotate the type, as TypeScript can infer it. For example:

let greeting = "Hello, TypeScript!"; // Inferred type: string
let temperature = 25; // Inferred type: number
let isAvailable = true; // Inferred type: boolean

// In the above example, TypeScript automatically infers the appropriate types based on the assigned values even though we didn't explicitly annotate the types.
