// TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds static typing and additional features to JavaScript, making it a more robust and scalable language for building large-scale applications.

// Here are some key features and concepts of TypeScript:

    // Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing, which allows you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors during development and provides better tooling support, such as intelligent code completion and refactoring.

    // Type Inference: TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that automatically infers the types based on the assigned values. You don't always have to explicitly annotate types, as TypeScript can often determine them from the context.

    // Interfaces: TypeScript supports interfaces, which define the structure of an object. Interfaces allow you to specify the properties and methods that an object should have. They enable better code documentation, reusability, and provide a way to enforce consistency across different parts of your codebase.

    // Classes and Inheritance: TypeScript includes class-based object-oriented programming features, such as classes, inheritance, and interfaces for implementing object-oriented patterns. It extends JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance model with a more familiar class syntax.

    // Generics: TypeScript supports generics, which enable you to write reusable and type-safe code components. Generics allow you to create functions, classes, or interfaces that can work with different types while maintaining type safety.

    // Modules and Namespaces: TypeScript provides a module system that allows you to organize your code into reusable and manageable units. You can use the import and export keywords to define dependencies between modules and create a modular code structure. Namespaces provide a way to organize related code into named scopes to avoid naming collisions.

    // Type Annotations and Assertions: TypeScript allows you to explicitly annotate types using a syntax similar to JavaScript comments. This can be helpful when the type inference system is unable to determine the correct types. Additionally, type assertions provide a way to override the inferred type of a value when you know its type more precisely.

    // Tooling and Integration: TypeScript integrates well with popular development tools and IDEs, providing features like autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring support. The TypeScript compiler (tsc) can transpile TypeScript code into plain JavaScript, allowing you to run it in any JavaScript environment.

// These are just some of the main features of TypeScript. It offers many more capabilities, such as enums, decorators, async/await, and advanced type manipulation features.

// TypeScript aims to enhance JavaScript development by adding static typing and additional language features while maintaining compatibility with existing JavaScript codebases. It helps catch errors early, improves code maintainability, and facilitates collaboration in larger projects.
